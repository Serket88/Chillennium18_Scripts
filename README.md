# Dimensional Shift

*Dimensional Shift* is a game that I created at [Chillennium 2018](http://www.chillennium.com/index.html) with the help of Ryan Sharpe and Shutong Liu.  Chillennium is a 48-hour locally based game jam at Texas A&M University.

The premise of the game is that you shoot waves of enemies in an arcade-style shoot-em-up.  The catch is that the enemies are attacking two bases and you have to defend both of them by teleporting between the floor and the ceiling...in VR.  It should be noted that this game won Best Recognition in VR.

## What is this repository?

This repository contains the scripts that we used or modified (we imported the SteamVR API for Unity 3D) to create the game.  The purpose of the repository is to display them as an example of my technical capabilities, though I assume it will quickly become dated like some of my other repositories.

## My Contributions

My contributions to this project were primarily with the VR interface.  My fellow programmer Ryan Sharpe handled enemy AI and projectiles, along with winning and losing.  I set up the VR rig and handled switching between various controller modes, the user interface, and managers among other things.
